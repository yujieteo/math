Topics

	1.	Partial differential equations
        I don't even understand the basics.
        Learn some inequalities.
	2.	Statistics
        I cannot even set up a statistical study or use an appropriate modelling technique.
        However, I am able to recognise when statistical knowledge might be useful.
	3.	Quantum theory
        Similarly, do not understand the basics.
	4.	Computer science
        I am trying to learn virtualisation.
