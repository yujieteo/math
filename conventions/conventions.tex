\section{Set Theory}
\label{section-set-theory}

\index{set theory!Zeremlo-Franekel}
\index{axiom!choice}
The Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms of set theory with the axiom of choice by default. 

Alternative foundations with homotopy type theory and the univalence axiom may be considered when appropriate in the appropriate sections.

Universes may also be used.

\section{Category theory}
\label{section-category-theory}

We follow these conventions \cite{Stacks} by default.  

\begin{definition}
	A (small) category, $\mathbf{C}$ consists of a \textit{set} of \textit{objects}. For each \textit{pair} of \textit{objects} there exists a \textit{set} of morphisms.
\end{definition}

Note that all italicised words can be changed to define enrichment, operads when necessarily.

\section{Algebra}
\label{section-algebra}

In algebra, a ring is a commutative unitary ring.

In representation theory, we may drop commutativity.

In analysis, we may drop the condition of unitary.

\section{Notation}

The natural integers refers to the positive integers, however this will be avoided.
