\index{topology}
\begin{definition}[Topology of open sets]
	\label{definition-topology-open-sets}
	For a set $X$, a collection of \textit{open} subsets 
	of the set $X$ is called a topology, denoted by $\tau$ 
	if arbitrary unions and finite intersections of each subset
	is in $\tau$.
\end{definition}

\index{topology}
\begin{definition}[Topology of closed sets]
	\label{definition-topology-closed-sets}
	For a set $X$, a collection of \textit{closed} subsets 
	of the set $X$ is called a topology, denoted by $\tau$ 
	if arbitrary intersections and finite unions of each subset
	is in $\tau$.
\end{definition}

\index{set!open}
\begin{definition}[Open set]
	\label{definition-open-set}
	An open set is a set $U$ in a topology $\tau$ of a set $X$.
\end{definition}

\index{set!closed}
\begin{definition}[Closed set]
	\label{definition-closed-set}
	An closed set $S$ is the complement of an open set $U$ 
	of a topology $\tau$ with respect to the main set $X$.
\end{definition}

\index{topology!closed sets}
\begin{lemma}[Topology of closed sets]
	The closed sets $(X - U)^\mathrm{c}$ 
	of a topological space $(X, \tau)$ form
	a topology $\tau$ given the open sets $U$ in the topology $\tau$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	The complement of the entire space $X$ relative to finite intersection of open sets $U$
	is a arbitrary union of closed sets, this follows by De Morgan's laws or Lemma \ref{lemma-de-morgan-first} and Lemma \ref{lemma-de-morgan-second}.
	The complement of the entire space $X$ relative to arbitrary union of open sets $U$
	is a finite intersection of closed sets, this follows by De Morgan's laws.

\index{topology}
\index{space!topological}
\begin{definition}[Topological space]
	\label{definition-topological-space}

	if arbitrary unions and finite intersections of each subset
	is in $\tau$. A pair $(X, \tau)$ is a topological space.
	By abuse of notation, we call $X$ a topological space.
