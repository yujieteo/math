\begin{definition}[Topology]
	\label{definition-topology}
	For a set $X$, a collection of subsets 
	of the set $X$ is called a topology, denoted by $\tau$ 
	if arbitrary unions and finite intersections of each subset
	is in $\tau$.
\end{definition}

\index{set!open}
\begin{definition}[Open set]
	\label{definition-open-set}
	An open set is a set $U$ in a topology $\tau$ of a set $X$.
\end{definition}

\index{set!closed}
\begin{definition}[Closed set]
	\label{definition-closed-set}
	An closed set $S$ is the complement of an open set $U$ 
	of a topology $\tau$ with respect to the main set $X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Topological space]
	\label{definition-topological space}
	For a set $X$, a collection of subsets 
	of the set $X$ is called a topology, denoted by $\tau$ 
	if arbitrary unions and finite intersections of each subset
	is in $\tau$. A pair $(X, \tau)$ is a topological space.
	By abuse of notation, we call $X$ a topological space.
