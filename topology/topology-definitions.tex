\section{Definitions}

We follow Steen and Seebach's presentation of topology \cite{Steen1995}.

\index{topology}
\begin{definition}[Topology of open sets]
	\label{definition-topology-open-sets}
	For a set $X$, a collection of \textit{open} subsets 
	of the set $X$ is called a topology, denoted by $\tau$ 
	if arbitrary unions and finite intersections of each subset
	is in $\tau$.
\end{definition}

\index{topology}
\begin{definition}[Topology of closed sets]
	\label{definition-topology-closed-sets}
	For a set $X$, a collection of \textit{closed} subsets 
	of the set $X$ is called a topology, denoted by $\tau$ 
	if arbitrary intersections and finite unions of each subset
	is in $\tau$.
\end{definition}

\index{set!open}
\begin{definition}[Open set]
	\label{definition-open-set}
	An open set is a set $U$ in a topology $\tau$ of a set $X$.
\end{definition}

\index{set!closed}
\begin{definition}[Closed set]
	\label{definition-closed-set}
	An closed set $S$ is the complement of an open set $U$ 
	of a topology $\tau$ with respect to the main set $X$.
\end{definition}

\index{topology!closed sets}
\begin{lemma}[Topology of closed sets]
	The closed sets $(X - U)^\mathrm{c}$ 
	of a topological space $(X, \tau)$ form
	a topology $\tau$ given the open sets $U$ in the topology $\tau$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	The complement of the entire space $X$ relative to finite intersection of open sets $U$
	is a arbitrary union of closed sets, this follows by De Morgan's laws or Lemma \ref{lemma-de-morgan-first} and Lemma \ref{lemma-de-morgan-second}.
	The complement of the entire space $X$ relative to arbitrary union of open sets $U$
	is a finite intersection of closed sets, this follows by De Morgan's laws.
\end{proof}

\index{topology}
\index{space!topological}
\begin{definition}[Topological space]
	\label{definition-topological-space}
	For a set $X$, a collection of subsets 
	of the set $X$ is called a topology, denoted by $\tau$ 
	if arbitrary unions and finite intersections of each subset
	is in $\tau$. A pair $(X, \tau)$ is a topological space.
	By abuse of notation, we call $X$ a topological space.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Open covers]
	\label{definition-open-cover}
	For a set $X$, a collection of subsets 
	of the set $X$ is called a topology, denoted by $\tau$ 
	if arbitrary unions and finite intersections of each subset
	is in $\tau$. A pair $(X, \tau)$ is a topological space.
	
	An open cover of $U$ on a open subset $V$
	of a a topological space $(X, \tau)$
	is a union of open sets $U = \cup U_i$ in 
	the topology $\tau$ such that 
	the open subset $V$ is contained in the open cover $U$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Finite open covers]
	\label{definition-finite-open-cover}
	For a set $X$, a collection of subsets 
	of the set $X$ is called a topology, denoted by $\tau$ 
	if arbitrary unions and finite intersections of each subset is in $\tau$. A pair $(X, \tau)$ is a topological space.
	
	A finite open cover of $U$ on a open subset $V$
	of a a topological space $(X, \tau)$
	is a finite union of open sets $U = \cup U_i$ in 
	the topology $\tau$ such that 
	the open subset $V$ is contained in the open cover $U$.
\end{definition}

\index{compact}
\begin{definition}[Compact topological space]
	\label{definition-compact-topological-space}
	For a set $X$, a collection of subsets 
	of the set $X$ is called a topology, denoted by $\tau$ 
	if arbitrary unions and finite intersections of each subset
	is in $\tau$. A pair $(X, \tau)$ is a topological space.
	
	A compact topological space $(X, \tau)$ is a topological space where every open cover, that is a union of a collection open sets $U = \cup U_i$ containing $X$
	admits a finite subcover, that is a finite union of 
	a subcollection of open sets $U = \cup U_i$.
\end{definition}

We now give the definition in terms of category theory.

\begin{remark}
	The category of topological spaces is both complete and cocomplete. From Definition \ref{definition-cocomplete} and \ref{definition-complete}, all small limits and colimits exist in the category of topological spaces.
\end{remark}

\index{compact}
\index{object!compact}
\begin{definition}[Compact topological space, compact object]
	\label{definition-compact-topological-space-cat}
	A compact topological space $(X, \tau)$ is a compact object in the category of topological spaces.\sidenote{See Definition \ref{definition-compact-object} for a general definition}

	A compact object is a corepresentable functor (hom object, in this case it is a topological space representing a set of open covers) from a locally small category\sidenote{We used the fact that the category of topological spaces is complete and cocomplete.} that admits filtered colimits such that homs out of it (open covers as homs) to a fixed object (the underlying topological space) preserve filtered colimits (finite subcovers).
\end{definition}

Colimits in the category of topological spaces are precisely the union of open covers. Filtered colimits in the category of topological spaces are precisely the union of finite covers. Admission means that there are finite subcovers.

\end{definition}

\index{object!final}

	If the set $\tau_1$ is contained in the set $\tau_2$, we say the topology 
	$\tau_1$ is coarser than $\tau_2$.
\end{definition}

\index{finer}
\begin{definition}[Finer]
	\label{definition-finer}

	$\tau_2$ is coarser than $\tau_1$.

\end{definition}

	\label{definition-limit-point}
