Understood (ontologies that reinvent this stuff)

Group, permutation of roots: Galois invented this ontology, you want to permute the roots of a polynomial equation and compose these permutations. With this ontology, and consider the trivial permutation, and compositions of permutations to be permutations, one arrives at the definition of the group. Also, which permutation when composed with a given permutation gives the trivial permutation? This must be the inverse permutation.

Group, symmetries of object: Cayley invented this ontology, he invented Cayley's theorem, groups are isomorphic to permutation subgroups of the symmetric group. The object remains invariant, so you can compose symmetries to get back the original object, and you can consider the what to compose to the any symmetry transformation to get back the trivial symmetry of doing nothing. This ontology is obtained when one consider that there is a bijection between left action on group elements, to permutations of group elements. To prove Cayley's theorem, consider the mapping a group element x to the left action on the group element gx, since the composition of group elements is closed by preserving the symmetries of an object, this must be a bijection on the set of group elements. Since this is a bijection on the set of group elements, the set of group elements is in bijection to the permutation of the group elements, and is hence isomorphic to a permutation subgroup of the symmetric group. The symmetric group is also a automorphism group on sets.

Group, group actions and representations: groups can be represented by their representations, from the group itself to the general linear group, you want compositions of linear representations be linear representations (or linear transformations), likewise for the trivial representations, and the existence of inverse representations. This also motivates the study of invariants of these matrices, therefore the character of representations is defined by the trace of these linear maps.

Group, categories of one object with all isomorphisms: consider that compositions of morphisms are all morphisms, if you add the stipulation of invertibility, and only require to study the symmetries (invertibility) of one object, you get the definition of a group being a groupoid of one object, or alternatively a category of one object with all isomorphisms on that object.

Group, generators and relators: consider a finite free group of n-alphabets, this gives the finite symmetric group on n-objects, freely adjoining the alphabet. Since this is a free group, you want to be able compose and take away elements of the free group easily. To get general groups, add additional relators for product of group elements to be the identity of the group to further constrain the definition of a group, these are called the relators. In fact, generators and relators are sufficient to define any finite group, and are enough to define a group. These are called the presentation of the group.
