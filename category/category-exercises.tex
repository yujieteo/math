\begin{exercise}[Opposite of a opposite category]
    \label{exercise-opposite-opposite-category}
Show that the opposite category of a opposite category is naturally isomorphic to the original
category of the opposite category.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    The functor taking hom-sets from $\mathrm{Hom}(X,Y) \rightarrow \mathrm{Hom}(Y,X) \rightarrow \mathrm{Hom}(X,Y)$.

    This is in the definition of a opposite category as per Definition \ref{definition-op-category} is a canonical identity natural isomorphism.
    \sidenote{The double dual functor yield a natural isomorphism similar to the double dual of a vector space is the motivating example for category theory.}
\end{proof}
