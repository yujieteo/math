More specifically any functor as coefficients.

Proof of subgroups of free groups being free using covering space of wedges of circles?

Proof that infinitely many primes split completely in an arbitrary extension of number fields using Dedekind zeta function with pole at 1. Let L be the Galois closure of K over Q. If l splits completely over L then it splits completely over Q. The ideals of prime norm in L are, apart from the (finitely many) primes that ramify over Q, the prime ideal factors of the rational primes that split completely in L over Q. But, from the Dedekind zeta function having a pole at s=1, there must be infinitely many prime ideals of prime norm in L. So infinitely many rational primes split completely in L, and so also in K.
