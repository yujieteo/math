Make this make sense: If one wants to summarize our knowledge of physics in the briefest possible terms, there are three really fundamental observations: (i) Space-time is a pseudo-Riemannian manifold M, endowed with a metric tensor and governed by geometrical laws. (ii) Over M is a vector bundle X with a nonabelian gauge group G. (iii) Fermions are sections of (???). R and F are not isomorphic; their failure to be isomorphic explains why the light fermions are light and presumably has its origins in a representation difference A in some underlying theory. All of this must be supplemented with the understanding that the geometrical laws obeyed by the metric tensor, the gauge fields, and the fermions are to be interpreted in quantum mechanical terms.

Maybe the first and clearest situation one sees motivic behavior is in the Weil conjectures (and this is how Grothendieck formulated the ideas around motives in the first place) Among other things the Weil conjectures (which are theorems by the way) tell you that the number of solutions to polynomial equations over finite fields controls/is controlled by the topology of the space of solutions over the complex numbers. Motives would certainly imply this sort of thing

The Wikipedia page is horrible and I will probably rewrite it at some point. Someone already suggested the Grothendieck ring of varieties K_0(Var) which is sort of related but isn’t quite what motives are… 

The point is that you see the same kinds of behaviors around the cohomology of algebraic varieties between all sorts of different cohomology theories, because all of those cohomology theories are supposed to be different realizations of the same underlying object, namely the motive of the variety. The idea is that every cohomology class should be explained by the existence of algebraic cycles in some sense, and those algebraic cycles can be realized as classes in various cohomology theories.

What is the best way to write down Frobenius reciprocity in terms of tensor products, resolutions and induced representations?

Proj is to Spec as projective varieties are to affine varieties. To elaborate on this, just as Spec takes a ring and gives you an affine scheme by putting a structure sheaf on the space of prime ideals with the Zariski topology, Proj takes a graded ring and gives you a (general) scheme by putting a structure sheaf on the space of homogeneous prime ideals with the Zariski topology. I'm leaving out some details, but you said you wanted an "intuitive" understanding.

It also implies that every countable family of non-empty finite sets has a choice function, which is equivalent to Kónig's lemma. Make this make sense?

As it stands, it looks like you're proving that every completely simple semigroup (with an idempotent) has a unique idempotent. This is not true, as otherwise every finite completely simple semigroup is a group (take the direct product of a non-trivial rectangular band and a group as a counter example). To make it more clear, the definition of a primitive idempotent needs updating. Let $E$ be the set of idempotents of a semigroup $S$ without zero. Then $\prec$, defined by $e \prec f$ if $ef = fe = e$ for $e,f \in E$, is a partial ordering of $E$. An idempotent is primitive if it minimal under this partial ordering. In other words, the idempotent $e$ is primitive if for all $f \in E$ we have $ef = fe = f \implies e = f$. Then the calculation you did shows that every idempotent is primitive.

“Closed category” with any monoidal product, like the hom-tensor adjunction, so cartesian there definitely refers to the cartesian product structure on C as opposed to a tensor product.

"Cartesian fibration" is named because of the existence of cartesian lifts for morphisms, which are named that because the paradigmatic example of a cartesian fibration is the codomain functor C^{\to} -> C for a category C that has all pullbacks (i.e. the existence of Cartesian squares.)

Referring to pullbacks as Cartesian squares is a bit more questionable than referring to Cartesian products, but you can justify it on the grounds that a Cartesian square is just a Cartesian product that lives in a slice category, products are pretty close to pullbacks in the grand scheme of things as they're both fundamental kinds of limits

Descartes did not just describe the plane as the product of a line with itself, he basically invented analytic algebraic geometry, which is the study of polynomial curves in n-dimensional affine k-space - which are exactly the equalizers of polynomial functions k^n -> k. So we are justified in naming both products and equalizers after Descartes, thus the term "Cartesian category" for a category with products and equalizers.

For curves the arithmetic and geometric genus are defined by finding a replacement smooth curve and taking its genus. For the geometric genus: the normalization. For the arithmetic genus: the deformation to smoothness. For higher dimensional compete varieties, the geometric genus is again defined by normalization, but the normalization isn’t smooth. The geometric genus is h^0,n, while you propose h^0,1. h^0,n is better because it is birationally invariant.

The **definition** of birationally equivalent is that there is are open dense subset that are isomorphic

Show equivalence of definitions: variety is irreducible iff every dense open subset is connected iff every sufficiently small open dense subset. Sufficiently small dense opens are a birational invariant

Example of  "affine basis" of the plane z=1 in R3? I'm curious if there is an element of this basis that corresponds to the origin. Is <1,0,1>,<0,1,1>, <0,0,1> an affine basis? A set is an affine basis of when you translate it so that one element  is the origin, the rest forms a basis

Explain: is that an algebraic scheme over a field can be covered by a finite number of spectra of finitely generated algebras. Those affine schemes that arise as the spectrum of a finitely generated algebra over a field are called algebraic, and the intuition behind this is that they are defined by a finite set of polynomials in a finite number of symbols. I think this terminology and point of view is common in the context of group schemes, see for example the notes of J.S. Milne

Hahn-Banach theorem, Banach-Tarski paradox, ultrafilter lemam, countable choice?

Hamilton-Cayley theorem in one sentence using algebraic geometry: true for diagonalizable matrices, which forms a Zariski dense set. (although it is not open, but it contains the open subset of matrices with distinct eigenvalues, this is where it feels perturbative Also, the irreducibility of affine space is assumed.) Compare to A is a square matrix, then it is diagonalizable after perturbation. Finally, as an example of the somewhat mysterious reduction steps in EGA, we can also restate and reprove it for integral domains by base change to the algebraic closure of the function field.

Hilbert's Weak Nullstellensatz shows that the “traditional points” are present as points of the scheme, and this carries over to any algebraically closed field. If the field is not algebraically closed, the traditional points are glued together into clumps by Galois conjugation, as in real affine line and the affine line over $F_p$. How does this even work?

Motivation for normalisers?

I understand why do we care about derived functors (enough injectives), but how to we understand it? Scholze uses it to give a very clean definition of etale cohomology and what does this even mean? Example: cohomology is the right defined functor from the “abelian space” (specifically spectra) and getting an abelian group. Note that abelian groups are a fully faithful inclusion into cohomology. What does it mean by enough injectives? Sheaf cohomology is the right derived functor to the global section functor? Answer; this is Grothendieck’s genius to use a functor for any coefficient. More specifically any functor as coefficients.

Proof of subgroups of free groups being free using covering space of wedges of circles?

Proof that infinitely many primes split completely in an arbitrary extension of number fields using Dedekind zeta function with pole at 1. Let L be the Galois closure of K over Q. If l splits completely over L then it splits completely over Q. The ideals of prime norm in L are, apart from the (finitely many) primes that ramify over Q, the prime ideal factors of the rational primes that split completely in L over Q. But, from the Dedekind zeta function having a pole at s=1, there must be infinitely many prime ideals of prime norm in L. So infinitely many rational primes split completely in L, and so also in K.

left exact localisations and why should we care about them?

list of diagram lemmas?

moving lemma?

perfect base field?

presentable and subobject classifier in topos?

quasi coherent sheaf?

smooth scheme?

the Fourier-Mukai transform and why should I care about it?

the Freudenthal suspension theorem and how is it used to define spectra?

the Freudenthal suspension theorem and how is it used to define spectra? Also, what motivated the suspension theorem, it was invented very early in the 1930s.

the McKay correspondence between Dublin diagrams, platonic splits, finite subgroups of the special orthogonal group in three dimensions, finite subgroups of the special unitary group, and the simple Lie group. Why should I care about the McKay correspedoence?

the condition for separability, which is all elements can be approximated arbitrarily by countale collection such that the distance measure for the norm can be done by picking x_j such that d(x_j, x), j is in integers, in the context of Stone duality? I thought about this because Stone duality can be thought of some completion of an experiment in logic.

the conjugation operation for ideals? Is it multiplication on the left giving 0.

the difference between Karmarkar's method and the simplex method? Why is it better?

the difference between a polynomial and a polynomial functions?

the difference between flat and locally free (locally have some basis?)

the difference between geometric fibres and geometrically connected?

the functor that works on opens that is the colimit of open overs on a product open covers over equalisers / descent such that applying this functor on a presheaf gives a separated sheaf, applying this functor again gives sheafification? Also how do we use separated morphisms in the definition.

the homotopy excision theorem and how does it prove the Freudenthal suspension theorem?

the implicit function theorem in differential geometry?

the left adjoint of the random variable functor? It seems to forget some set of real numbers and converts it into outcomes?

the mathematical motivation behind the notion of filtration?

the motivation behind a diagonal morphism, and why should we care about separated morphisms so much it warrants its own functor adjunction?

the motivation for Jaffard domains, and Prufer domains?

the motivation for Landau's function? Why should I care about the maximum order of an element in the symmetric group?

the motivation for residue fields? They say it is the natural generalisation of the codomain / range of a point or the values of each point?

the motivation of Galois conjugate?

the motivation of axiom K?
