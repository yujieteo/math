\begin{example}[Blowing up to get gradients]
    \label{example-blow-up-gradient}
    The problem is to describe the gradients $m$ of
    all line $y = mx + c$ in the real plane $\mathbb{R}^2$.

    For vertical lines, add the point at infinity.
    Therefore, the gradients $m$ can be distinguished 
    by a projective line $\mathbb{P}^1$.

    A more general example would be to turn this into
    Grassmannians.
